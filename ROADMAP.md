# PhotoCraft roadmap

**Stage: alpha** · next: beta, ~30 points (ready for real work ~45% → ~75%, with reliable PSD) and ~1,100–1,800 h away

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-10 · **Last updated:** 2026-10-10 · **Change:** major (first version: full re-measure against Photoshop 2026 27.11.0) · **Target:** Adobe Photoshop 2026

PhotoCraft's one-page summary of how close it is to Adobe Photoshop 2026 (27.11.0, measured from
the installed app on 2026-10-10) at version 0.6.0. Detail: [target-app parity](docs/target-app-parity.md)
(methodology, weights, evidence), [gaps](docs/gaps.md) (the ranked work list),
[roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) (milestones, current focus), [scorecard](docs/scorecard.md) and
[menu checklist](docs/parity-checklist.md) (both generated and measured),
[architecture](docs/architecture.md).

Hours are Opus 5.5 agent wall-clock hours for one agent working sequentially, calibrated from this
repository's 1,004 merged PRs (see [calibration](docs/target-app-parity.md#remaining-effort-and-calibration)).
About 80% of the work parallelizes.

## Headline numbers

| | Value | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| **Feature breadth** | **~76%** | partly measured: menus 628/628, tools 53/68, panels 30/35, formats 13+4 of 31 |
| **Ready for real work** | **~45%** (40–50%) | estimated: weighted by dimension below |
| Mainstream practitioner | ~43% (38–48%) | estimated: weekly areas of a typical pro, with discounts ([method](docs/target-app-parity.md#mainstream-practitioner-43)) |
| Essentials user | ~61% (55–67%) | estimated: core features only ([method](docs/target-app-parity.md#essentials-user-61)) |
| Remaining to **beta** | **~1,100–1,800 h** | estimated |
| Remaining to **full parity** | **~2,300–4,100 h** | estimated; AI and plug-ins need owner decisions |

### Readiness by audience

| Audience | Ready % | Opus 5.5 agent-hours to ~95% | Work that dominates |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Full target (ready for real work) | ~45% (additive weighted sum: 46%) | 2,300–4,100 | Everything below, plus AI tier, plug-in/scripting ecosystem, video, localization, hardware |
| Mainstream practitioner | ~43% | 1,700–2,800 | Depth in the 11 weekly areas (1,180–2,000), performance budgets, stability on real machines, PSD exchange with Photoshop |
| Essentials user | ~61% | 400–700 | Startup and GPU robustness, brush and transform responsiveness, Type tool, discoverability (flyouts, commit buttons), AVIF/PDF open |

Hours calibrated as in [Remaining effort](docs/target-app-parity.md#remaining-effort-and-calibration) (2–9 h per checklist
item, 8–20 h per format or subsystem, from the repo's 1,004 merged PRs); each tier is a subset of
the one above. About 80% parallelizes (independent crates and command modules); performance
architecture and the PSD writer are the serial parts.

**Why alpha.** Core workflows (open, layer, select, paint, adjust, filter, type, save) work end to
end, and breadth is high, but users of 0.5/0.6 have 579 open issues, 22 of 25 performance budgets
are missed, and PSDs we write are not yet reliably accepted by Photoshop (#1281, #2469). Beta
needs ~75% ready and no blocking PSD gap. The [alpha gate](docs/roadmap.md#alpha-gate) passes: all six core workflows
(retouch, composite, cut-out, design, paint, PSD exchange) complete end to end and save and reopen;
four are partial in depth, none blocked.
