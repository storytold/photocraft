//! Crop tool gestures. In Photoshop's "Classic Mode" (Use Classic Mode, P) the frame moves and
//! turns over a fixed image, as described below; in its default mode (`crop_mode`) the box stays
//! upright on screen and the same gestures inside and outside it move and turn the image behind
//! it instead (the view turns with the frame, so hit-testing in document space is unchanged):
//!
//! - with no frame, or inside the untouched default frame, a drag draws a new frame; ⇧ makes it
//!   square, ⌥ draws it from the centre, and holding Space while drawing repositions the frame
//!   being drawn;
//! - inside the frame, a drag moves it;
//! - on an edge or corner, a drag resizes it along the frame's own (possibly turned) axes; ⇧ keeps
//!   the frame's aspect ratio, ⌥ resizes about the centre, and an options-bar ratio preset always
//!   holds;
//! - outside the frame (off its handles) the pointer is the rotate cursor and a drag turns the
//!   frame about its centre, ⇧ in 15° steps, with the angle beside the pointer (#1792). As in
//!   Photoshop, a new frame is drawn after the pending one is committed or cancelled;
//! - while a frame is drawn or resized, its W × H (in px, as ↵ would crop it) shows beside the
//!   pointer, like the marquee's readout ([`sizing`]);
//! - with a pending frame and no gesture, the arrow keys nudge it 1 document px (⇧ 10 px) instead
//!   of the selection or layer, and X swaps it between portrait and landscape about its centre
//!   (keeping its angle, and swapping an options-bar ratio with it) instead of the colours
//!   ([`keys`], #1919). In the default mode the arrows move the image under the box instead.
//!
//! ↵ commits (`image.crop`, see `canvas::commit_crop`, with the turn as its `angle`: the document
//! is rotated so the frame is upright, then cropped to it) and Esc cancels. The pending frame lives
//! in `UiState::crop_rect` (the frame before its turn) and `UiState::crop_angle` (degrees,
//! clockwise on screen), so the control channel reads both. Both modes commit the same crop.
//!
//! As in Photoshop, from the first press until the crop is committed or cancelled the canvas also
//! shows the layers' pixels past its edges (kept by a crop with Delete Cropped Pixels off, or moved
//! out), with transparency out to the frame, under the shield ([`shows_beyond_canvas`]).
