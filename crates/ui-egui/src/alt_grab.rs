//! An ⌥-click the desktop took (#1658, #1659).
//!
//! Many Linux desktops move a window with Alt+drag: Cinnamon (Linux Mint's default), MATE, Xfce,
//! and KDE before Plasma 6. Their window manager grabs every Alt+left press, so the click never
//! reaches PhotoCraft: the Brush's ⌥ Eyedropper samples nothing and the Clone Stamp gets no source
//! point, while the ⌥ cursor still shows (the keyboard is not grabbed until the press). Nothing in
//! the app can win that grab back, but its signature is clear: the pointer "leaves" the window from
//! well inside the canvas while ⌥ is held with a tool whose ⌥-click matters (X11 and Wayland report
//! a grab as the pointer leaving), and comes back to a window that still has the keyboard focus
//! when the button is released. The status bar then says what happened and how to get ⌥-click
//! back. An Alt+Tab away leaves the window without focus, so it never shows the message.
