//! Add Anchor Point and Delete Anchor Point tools (P group with the Pen, #1044), as in Photoshop.
//! They edit the targeted path only (#12762, #12705): the saved path selected in the Paths panel,
//! the targeted vector mask or the active shape layer's path (not while that layer is hidden), or the work
//! path. A top-level shape layer that is not active is left alone, unlike Direct Selection; one inside a group is still edited as before.
//!
//! * Add Anchor Point: hovering a segment highlights it and shows where the anchor would go; a
//!   click inserts it there (`path.addAnchor`). A curve is split without changing its shape, into
//!   a smooth anchor; a straight segment gets a corner. The new anchor is selected with its
//!   direction handles showing, and a drag from the click moves it, as in Photoshop (#8653).
//! * Delete Anchor Point: hovering an anchor highlights it; a click removes it
//!   (`path.deleteAnchor`), joining its neighbours.
//! * ⌥ swaps the two tools and ⌘/Ctrl is Direct Selection (`direct_select`) while held; ⌥-click
//!   with Delete Anchor Point on an anchor selects its whole subpath instead.
//! * The Pen does both with Auto Add/Delete on (its options bar, on by default, #4144): a click on
//!   a segment adds, a click on an anchor deletes, except an open subpath's end points; ⇧ turns it
//!   off while held. It edits the active path, or while a path is being drawn that path (#6140),
//!   and drawing carries on from its last anchor.
//!
//! Each click (or add and drag) is one history step; a click on nothing it can edit does nothing;
//! ⌥-click on an anchor with Delete Anchor Point only selects.
