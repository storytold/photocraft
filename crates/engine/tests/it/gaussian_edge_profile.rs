//! #11528: Gaussian Blur's edge profile on an opaque interior edge, pinned at RGB8 and RGB16 and
//! across the direct command and an action (ATN) replay.
//!
//! The issue measures Photoshop 27.11 against PhotoCraft on a black/white step with no selection,
//! mask, transparency or smart object, so nothing but the kernel can explain the difference:
//! at radius 2.3 the reported red levels for x = 10..22 are
//!
//! ```text
//! Photoshop   0, 2,10,27,59,103,152,196,228,245,253,255,255
//! PhotoCraft  2, 6,16,35,65,105,150,190,220,239,249,253,255
//! ```
//!
//! PhotoCraft's row is what a Gaussian sampled at whole pixels with sigma = radius and a 3-sigma
//! window gives (its variance is 0.6 % short of 2.3^2 from that truncation), so the pipeline adds
//! no error of its own: the gap is the two applications' radius-to-blur mapping, 8 levels at
//! radius 2.3, 5 at radius 1 and 1 at radius 5 (where PhotoCraft already runs box passes). No
//! single factor maps one to the other, as the issue itself notes, so the kernel is deliberately
//! left alone here; what this file does is pin the profile that PhotoCraft produces today, at both
//! depths and on both routes, and ratchet the distance to Photoshop's measured row so a future
//! kernel change is a decision with a number attached to it instead of a silent drift.
