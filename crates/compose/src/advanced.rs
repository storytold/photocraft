//! Layer Style › Blending Options › Advanced Blending in the CPU compositor (the oracle):
//!
//! - **Knockout.** Inside the layer's shape the backdrop is replaced by the knockout target
//!   before the layer composites: for Shallow the bottom of the enclosing group (the backdrop the
//!   group's stack started from: transparent in an isolated group, the layers beneath in a
//!   pass-through one) or of the clipping group (the base layer's content); for Deep, and for
//!   Shallow at the top level, the Background layer (transparency without one). Isolated groups
//!   and grouped clipping layers stop a deep knockout at their bottom, as Photoshop renders it
//!   (see [`Scope`]); pass-through groups let it through. Fill opacity sets how much of the layer
//!   shows over the knocked-out area, layer opacity how strong the whole knockout is.
//! - **Blend Clipped Layers as Group off.** The base composites alone; each clipped layer then
//!   composites onto the result in its own mode, kept inside the base's shape (its alpha with
//!   masks, times its opacity).
//! - **Transparency Shapes Layer off.** The layer's effects and knockout cover the whole layer
//!   (its masks still apply) instead of following its transparency.
//! - **Layer / Vector Mask Hides Effects.** The effects are built from the layer without that
//!   mask, and the mask is applied to the finished layer and effects.
//!
//! Blend Interior Effects as Group lives in [`crate::effects`], where interior effects are
//! painted. Every path here is skipped for layers at Photoshop's defaults, so documents that
//! don't use these options render exactly as before at no extra cost.
//!
//! Measured on the psd-tools knockout files (deep/shallow, nested, pass-through, no Background,
//! groups with knockout). Not yet measured against Photoshop: the clip of individually blended
//! clipped layers (base alpha × opacity, ignoring its fill), Transparency Shapes Layer off, and the
//! masks hiding effects.
