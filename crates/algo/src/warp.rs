//! Mesh warps (Edit › Transform › Warp, smart-object warps): resampling a surface through any
//! forward map, such as a [`photocraft_geom::warp::Warp`] (bicubic Bezier patches or a preset).
//!
//! The source rectangle is subdivided into a fine grid whose vertices are mapped forward; each
//! cell's two triangles are rasterized in destination space with the source position
//! interpolated barycentrically, then the source is sampled there (premultiplied, nearest /
//! bilinear / Photoshop's Keys bicubic, like Free Transform). Cells are a few pixels across in
//! both the source and the destination (a thin layer stretched far gets as many cells as its
//! warped size needs), so the piecewise-affine inverse is within a small fraction of a pixel of
//! the true one; affine
//! maps (the identity included) are reproduced exactly. Where the warp shrinks the source, each
//! pixel instead averages a grid of bilinear subsamples over its source footprint (about one per
//! source pixel), so thin lines don't alias. Where the warp folds over itself, [`Fold`] decides
//! what shows: for Edit › Transform › Warp and smart objects the part dragged furthest is on top and
//! the layers composite; for other mesh maps (lens corrections, distortions) the later
//! (lower-right) cell wins. Work is split per destination tile (parallel on native).
