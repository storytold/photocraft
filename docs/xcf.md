# GIMP XCF documents

PhotoCraft opens GIMP's native `.xcf` files (and `.xcf.gz`) with their layers, read only. File ›
Open, recent files, drops, the CLI (`convert`, `info`, `batch`) and automation (`doc.open`, MCP)
use the same reader in `photocraft-io` (`crates/io/src/xcf.rs`). A file is recognised by its
`gimp xcf ` signature, so an XCF with another extension still opens as one. Save suggests
`.pcraft`, which keeps everything PhotoCraft holds; exporting as `.xcf` fails with a message.

## What is kept

| | Open |
|---|---|
| Pixel layers (any size and position, also off-canvas), opaque or with alpha | yes |
| Groups, nested; a group in Pass through mode | yes |
| Names, visibility, opacity, offsets | yes |
| Layer masks | yes, applied or disabled as in GIMP |
| Blend modes | the 2.10 set and the legacy set, mapped to Photoshop's (table below) |
| Locks (alpha, content, position), colour tags | yes |
| Precision | 8 and 16-bit integer as such; 32-bit integer as 16-bit; 16/32/64-bit float as 32-bit float |
| Linear-light precisions | the document gets a linear sRGB (or linear gray) profile |
| Colour profile (`icc-profile` parasite), resolution, guides, comment | yes |
| Grayscale, RGB | as such; indexed images open as RGB |
| Extra channels, the saved selection | yes (alpha channels, the selection) |
| Text, vector and link layers | as their pixels, with a note |
| Compression | none, RLE, zlib |
| XCF versions | 0 to 26 (GIMP 1.x to 3.2); newer files open with a note, unknown parts skipped |

Not kept, each with a note on open: non-destructive layer effects (GIMP 3's layer filters; the
layer opens unfiltered), paths, floating selections, item sets, sample points. Layer effects are
not representable without GEGL's operations; paths could follow later.

## Blend modes

| GIMP | PhotoCraft |
|---|---|
| Normal, Dissolve, Multiply, Screen, Overlay, Difference, Darken only, Lighten only, Divide, Hard light, Vivid light, Pin light, Linear light, Hard mix, Exclusion, Linear burn, Subtract | the same |
| Addition | Linear Dodge (Add) |
| Dodge, Burn | Color Dodge, Color Burn |
| Pass through (groups) | Pass Through |
| Soft light (both the 2.10 and the legacy one) | Soft Light (GIMP's formula differs a little; noted) |
| HSV Hue / Saturation / Value, HSL Color, LCH Hue / Chroma / Color / Lightness, Luminance | Hue, Saturation, Luminosity, Color (Photoshop's HSL-based modes; noted) |
| Luma darken only, Luma lighten only | Darker Color, Lighter Color (noted) |
| Behind, Grain extract, Grain merge, Color erase, Erase, Merge, Split | Normal, with a note |

## How the composite differs from GIMP

Two of GIMP's defaults have no Photoshop counterpart, so a file opened in PhotoCraft can render
a little differently from GIMP; both are noted on open when they apply:

- **Linear light.** Since 2.10 GIMP blends most modes and composites every layer (alpha blending
  too) in linear light by default. PhotoCraft, like Photoshop, composes in the document's own
  encoding. Semi-transparent edges, masks and most blend modes therefore render slightly
  differently: in the test files, a Multiply layer at 60% differs by up to 38/255 in one channel,
  anti-aliased text edges by up to 73/255 at the edge pixels. A layer whose blend and composite
  spaces GIMP set to *RGB (perceptual)* matches PhotoCraft within 1/255 (the `-perceptual` test
  files).
- **Clip to backdrop.** GIMP composites every mode but Normal with *Clip to backdrop*: the layer
  shows nothing where the layers beneath it are transparent. PhotoCraft shows it there. The
  difference only appears over transparent areas of the stack.

- **Clamping after alpha.** For modes whose result can leave 0..1 (Addition, Subtract, Divide,
  Dodge, Burn, Linear light), GIMP applies the pixel's alpha and the layer's opacity first and
  clamps at the end; Photoshop clamps the blend result first. Fully opaque pixels at 100% match
  exactly; translucent ones differ where the raw result overshoots.

Modes without an equivalent open as Normal, and the HSV/LCH/luma modes use Photoshop's HSL-based
formulas, so those layers render differently; the note names each layer.

## Limits and safety

Written from the public XCF specification (https://developer.gimp.org/core/standards/xcf/) and
files GIMP 3.2 writes; no GIMP code. Every read is bounds-checked and returns an error on a
malformed file, never a panic: canvases at most 300,000 px a side and 1 GiB of decoded pixels,
at most 8,192 layers and 1,024 channels, nesting at most 64 deep, property payloads at most
64 MiB, strings 1 MiB, gzipped files inflating to at most 1 GiB. Tile data is decoded into the
exact size the drawable declares; a run that crosses a tile or a zlib stream that ends early is an
error. The property lengths the specification warns about (`PROP_COLORMAP`, `PROP_USER_UNIT`) are
computed from the payload instead of trusted. Truncated files are covered by tests at every cut.

## Verification

Unit tests (`crates/io/src/xcf/tests.rs`) build XCF files from the specification with a small
writer and check every compression, precisions, pointer widths, groups by item path, masks,
channels, the colour map, parasites, limits and malformed input.

Real files come from GIMP 3.2.6 itself (`scripts/xcf_fixtures.py`, run inside GIMP; fixtures in
`crates/io/tests/fixtures/xcf/`, 28 files, 220 KB): procedural layers the tests regenerate sample
for sample, and for each file GIMP's own merged rendering as a PNG. `crates/io/tests/xcf.rs`
checks the layer data against the formulas and our composite against GIMP's:

| File | Composite vs GIMP |
|---|---|
| `layers-8bit-perceptual`, `mask-perceptual`, `text-perceptual` | within 0.5/255 everywhere |
| `gray16`, `indexed`, `channel` | within 0.3/255 |
| `groups-perceptual` | within 0.5/255 except where Clip to backdrop applies (15% of pixels) |
| `legacy-modes-perceptual` | Addition, Subtract, Divide, Dodge, Burn, Hard light, Exclusion, Linear light within 0.5/255 on opaque pixels (translucent ones differ by the clamping order above); the approximated modes reported |
| the default (linear-light) files | the known gap, measured: up to 38/255 (Multiply), 59/255 (mask edge), 73/255 (text edge) |
