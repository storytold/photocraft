# Command-line interface

`apps/photocraft-cli` provides the following current subcommands:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `convert` | Open one document and export it to another format |
| `info` | Print document size, mode, depth, and layer information as JSON |
| `run` | Open or create a document, execute engine commands, and optionally save |
| `batch` | Apply an action list to files in one input directory |
| `droplet` | Run a PhotoCraft droplet against files or folders |
| `commands` | List command IDs and parameter documentation |
| `mcp` | Start the MCP server on stdio, optionally bridged to the desktop app |
| `serve` | Start the JSON-lines headless server on stdio or loopback TCP |

Use `photocraft-cli --help` (or `photocraft-cli <subcommand> --help`) as the executable source of truth. A typical bounded command run is:

```sh
photocraft-cli run input.psd \
  --cmd image.adjustments.invert \
  --out output.png
```

### Missing font warnings

If a type layer uses a font family that is not installed, `convert` and `run`
write a warning to standard error before exporting; they do not silently present
the fallback rendering as an exact match. `info --compact` includes the same
warning in its `warnings` JSON array, without writing it to stderr. `run`
also adds `warnings` to the JSON result for the command that first exposes
the missing family. A multi-command `run` reports each missing family once,
even if later commands still use it.

Warnings do not change the saved document's font declarations and do not stop
the operation. To list or replace the missing families intentionally, use
`type.resolveMissingFonts` on the document.

Paths supplied to the current CLI are ordinary operating-system paths. The CLI does not restrict them to a workspace root. Batch output creates the requested output directory, and save operations may create parent directories. `batch` refuses an output directory that is its input directory (the results would replace the originals) unless `--in-place` is given. Run untrusted action files only in an appropriately isolated account or environment.

CLI parsing reports malformed flags and JSON as errors, and a flag the subcommand doesn't take (a typo such as `--fromat`) is a usage error (exit status 2) rather than being ignored. It is not a security policy layer. Engine commands remain responsible for validating their own parameters.
